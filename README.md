# TumorPurity_Prediction
Prediction of tumor purity, stromal and immune infiltration in ovarian cancer samples by implementing library estimate. 

### Details
A custom R script which takes in data from GSE datasets and pre-processes gene expression (.CEL) files to create a gene expression set using package affy was implemented. The script also uses library estimate to predict stromal and immune infiltration in ovarian cancer patient samples along with predicting tumor purity.

### Requirements
This script requires user to pre-install following R packages from bioconductor and R-Forge
1. Affy
2. R.Utils
3. Estimate
